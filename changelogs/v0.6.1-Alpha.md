## News! 
- Added `worldinfo` command to display information about the current world.
- Added `listcoords` command to list all saved coordinates.
- Added `delcoords` command to delete saved coordinates by name.

## Improvements!
- Improved command handling by adding aliases for some commands Like:
  - `dc` for `disconnect`
  - `cmd` for `command`
  - `inv` for `inventory`
- In Slash command version of `coords`, instead of 3 separate options for x, y, and z, now it takes a single string input in the format "x,y,z". Just like in the text command version. Make sure to separate x, y, and z with space.
- Modularized some parts of the code for better readability and maintainability. (some commands for now)

## Fixes!
- Fixed an error that occurs on startup while loading channel id from settings.json by removing the duplicate declaration of `logChannelId`.
